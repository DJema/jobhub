### Authentication

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f193348b2004466ba69f53bec6f9de9a)](https://www.codacy.com/app/alexH2456/authentication?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=scrum-gang/authentication&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/scrum-gang/authentication/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/scrum-gang/authentication?branch=master)

#### Description

ðŸ‘® Provides authentication/user management for all jobhub microservices. Uses JWT for authentication.

Each user has the following required attributes:

- `id`: A unique ID generated for each user.
- `email`: An email address used for login.
- `password`: The users password. All passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- `type`: The type of user. Can be Applicant or Recruiter.
- `verified`: Whether the user has verfied their email after creating their account. Required to be able to login.

#### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scrum-gang/authentication.git
cd authentication
npm install
npm start
```

#### Deployment

Builds are automated using Travis and deployed on Heroku.

There are two Heroku deployments:

- Staging: <https://jobhub-authentication-staging.herokuapp.com/>
- Production: <https://jobhub-authentication.herokuapp.com/>

The staging deployment should be used for all development/testing purposes, in order to keep production from being poluted with test data.

Please note that any new builds on the **development** branch will **wipe** the staging database.

#### Typical usage

1. Create user using `/signup`.
2. Verify new user by clicking link in email received.
3. Login using `/login`, keep JWT token.
4. Can get logged in user using `/users/self` and passing token in header.

#### Endpoint Restrictions

All `/users` endpoints except for `/users/self` are restricted to moderators only. Moderators have unrestricted access to all endpoints. Only a moderator can promote another user to a moderator role.

Note: Restrictions on endpoints can be bypassed by passing the `secret` header in the request. Ask someone on authentication for the secret or see pinned message on authentication channel on Discord.

:pushpin: Keep track of job applications ad-hoc

#### How to setup the project
Please check our [contributors guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Why use the JobHub Extension
The Chrome extension is meant to be an ad-hoc access to the JobHub services. When the users are on a job application website, they don't need to stop browsing the post in order to open the JobHub website on a separate tab. Instead, they can start tracking the given application via the popup submit directly on the job posting website.

#### Folder Structure
```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .github # contains Code of Conduct & templates for PR/Issues
â”œâ”€â”€ build   # generated by Webpack. Contains the final js/html/css/resources
â”œâ”€â”€ data    # list of companies to scrape
â”œâ”€â”€ lib     # generated by Bucklescript. ReasonML -> Javascript
â”œâ”€â”€ src     # ReasonReact components & global stylesheet
â”œâ”€â”€ .editorconfig       # linter
â”œâ”€â”€ .travis.yml         # CI
â”œâ”€â”€ bsconfig.json       # Bucklescript config
â”œâ”€â”€ jsconfig.json       # VSCode intellisense for Chrome API
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json       # Chrome Extension config
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Node config
â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html          # html of the extension
â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js   # Webpack config
```

#### Architecture
```bash
           popup.html
               |
             App.re
        {token, userID}
               |
   +-----------+-----------+
   |                       |
Login.re               JobApp.re
                           |
                   ScrapingInputs.re
```

`token` is the state variable which is initially obtained by `Login` during the authentication process and in subsequent  execustions of the extension its validity is confirmed by `App` directly. `userID` is also obtained during the initial login process. In case of a deprecated `token`, both the `userID` and the `token` are cleared from the browser's memory. Both variables are passed onto the `JobApp` component to be able to fetch CVs and to submit job applications.

The system leverages the following modules
- `ScrapingFunctions.re`: functions related to extracting/processing HTML elements
- `Services.re`: functions related to asynchronous actions external to the extension (load files/API calls)
- `SyncStorage.re`: functions related to the Chrome storage management
- `Uilities.re`: general purpose helper functions


#### Limitations
* Currently, the only supported `posted date` scraper pattern is `"<num> days ago"`
* Currently, the extension does not have a `deadline date` scraper
* Because of the [bucklescript-chrome](https://github.com/jchavarri/bucklescript-chrome.git#start-extensions) bindings used to build the extension,
we are locked with outdated versions of core libraries such as `React` and `Bucklescript`
* For the same reason as above, we can't use Chrome's [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts).
    Instead we inject a script into the active website to extract DOM information.
