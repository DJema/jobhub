#### How to setup the project
Please check our [contributors guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Why use the JobHub Extension
The Chrome extension is meant to be an ad-hoc access to the JobHub services. When the users are on a job application website, they don't need to stop browsing the post in order to open the JobHub website on a separate tab. Instead, they can start tracking the given application via the popup submit directly on the job posting website.

#### Folder Structure

#### Architecture
```bash
           popup.html
               |
             App.re
             {token}
               |
   +-----------+-----------+
   |                       |
Login.re               JobApp.re
                           |
                   ScrapingInputs.re
```

`token` is the state variable which is initially obtained by `Login` during the authentication process and in subsequent  execustions of the extension its validity is confirmed by `App` directly. The variable is passed onto the `JobApp` component to be able to submit job applications.

The system leverages the following modules
- `ScrapingFunctions.re`: functions related to extracting/processing HTML elements
- `Services.re`: functions related to asynchronous actions external to the extension (load files/API calls)
- `SyncStorage.re`: functions related to the Chrome storage management
- `Uilities.re`: general purpose helper functions


#### Limitations
* Currently, the only supported `posted date` scraper pattern is `"<num> days ago"`
* Currently, the extension does not have a `deadline date` scraper
* Because of the [bucklescript-chrome](https://github.com/jchavarri/bucklescript-chrome.git#start-extensions) bindings used to build the extension,  
we are locked with outdated versions of core libraries such as `React` and `Bucklescript`
* For the same reason as above, we can't use Chrome's [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts).  
    Instead we inject a script into the active website to extract DOM information.
